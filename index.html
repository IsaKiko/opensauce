	<ul> 
	<li>1 large can of mango</li>
	<li>1 tblsp. Turmeric powder</li>
	<li>1 tsp. Chilli Powder</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
	<li>1 tsp. Sugar</li>
	<li>Curry Leaves</li>
	<li>1 tsp. Mustard seeds</li>
	<li>Dried red whole chillis</li>
	<li>1 tblsp. fenugreek seeds</li>
	<li>Greek yoghurt</li></ul> </span></div>
						<div><span class="detail_description"> <b>Instructions:</b> </span><span> <br> Add oil to a pot and put on high heat. Add one of the mustard seeds to
the pot and cover with lid. Once mustard seed pops, add a pinch to the
pot and recover. Wait until all have popped, then reduce heat to
medium.

Add canned mango to the pot, and bring to boil. Separately, put a small
pan on low heat. Fry dried chillies, curry leaves, chilli powder, and
tumeric until tumeric turns from bright yellow to golden brown.

<i>Warning:</i> if pan is too hot, the chilli powder will start to burn.
This experience is a lot like gassing yourself. Once fried, add spices
to pot of mango, and add salt and sugar to taste. Add fenugreek as
well. Reduce heat to a simmer, and break down mango with wooden spoon.

Once mango is broken down into a thick soup, take off heat and leave to
sit until cooled. Once cooled to room temperature, stir in greek
yoghurt until curry becomes a light yellow color (but not white: this
means you've added too much greek yoghurt). It's important to wait
until the curry has cooled for this last step, otherwise the yoghurt
may curdle. Transfer to fridge, and serve cold with other dishes. </span></div>

						<div><span class="detail_description"> <b>Instructions:</b> </span><span>  <br>
         Buy as many chillis as you can carry home from the market. Any variety is fine, but the sauce will be especially tasty if you use habeneros or jalape&ntilde;os.
         Use a food processer to turn , plus garlic, into a paste. Chopping them up by hand is not recommended, as it takes a very long time, chilli juice will be lost, and you will accidentally touch your eyes at some point and be in agony.
         Once chillis and garlic are turned into a paste, Add salt until the sauce tastes slightly undersalted. Because you will eventually reduce the sauce, you should not salt to taste.
         Add raw sugar. Add so much that the sauce is about 30 per cent sweeter than you like, because the fermentation process will reduce the sweetness quite drastically.
         Pour paste into hip mason jars, and cover with something that breathes, like cheesecloth. Put the jar(s) far away from the reach of pets and children.
         After uni, muddle the sauce a little with a spoon. Don't leave the spoon in the sauce, though.
         After a few days, you should begin to see bubbling. If mold grows on the surface of the sauce, simply remove it with a spoon.
         When bubbling has subsided (usually after aroun two weeks), your sauce has fermented. Put it in a pot and bring it to a near-boil. Try to hold your breath.
         Add vinegar to the pot. White and brown vinegars are both alright. White may do more to preserve the vibrancy of your sauce colour, but brown may result in a more complex flavour.
         Allow your sauce to reduce slowly. Hold your breath here too.
         Once sauce is of a desirably consistency, taste it, and add salt as needed.
         Return sauce to hip mason jar. It can now life in your pantry.</span></div>
